# HK-rental-propety-web-scrap-project

In this project, my group mates and I use Python packages like beautifulsoup and selenium to scrap data from multiple propety agency websites, Centraline and CNP.
Then, we clean and analyze the data with Pandas, and plot the graphs to visualize the data with matplotlib.

Please see the ppt file "Web Scraping Project" as the end product of this project.
